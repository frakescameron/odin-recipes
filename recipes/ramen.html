        <h2>🐟 Featured Recipe: Ramen </h2>
            <p>Packaged ramen is the ultimate quick comfort food—warm, savory, and satisfying in minutes. Each bite of springy noodles is soaked in a rich, umami-packed broth, whether it's classic soy, spicy miso, or creamy tonkotsu. It's salty, flavorful, and deeply satisfying, perfect for late-night cravings or busy days when you need something fast and filling.</p>
            <p>A blank canvas at heart, instant ramen is easily customizable—add an egg, green onions, veggies, or a dash of chili oil to turn a humble packet into a delicious personal creation. It’s budget-friendly, shelf-stable, and always hits the spot.</p>
